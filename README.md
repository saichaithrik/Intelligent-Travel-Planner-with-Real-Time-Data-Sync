Intelligent Travel Planner with Real-Time Data Sync
Project Overview:
The Intelligent Travel Planner with Real-Time Data Sync is a full-stack web application that empowers users to seamlessly plan their trips by integrating real-time flight and hotel data. The platform allows users to search for available flights and accommodations, manage bookings, and finalize their travel plans—all in one place. The application provides a smooth and efficient experience, making it easier for travelers to book both flights and hotels with accurate, up-to-date information.
Key Features:
1.	Live Flight and Hotel Data Synchronization:
o	The system integrates live data from flight and hotel providers, ensuring users have access to the most up-to-date availability and pricing for their travel plans.
2.	Real-Time Booking Management:
o	Users can book flights and hotels in real-time. The system ensures that the booking process is seamless and straightforward, with dynamic updates and instant confirmation.
3.	Advanced Search and User Input Validation:
o	Users can search for flights and hotels based on various criteria, such as departure and arrival cities, dates, and the number of guests. The system validates inputs for accuracy and ensures the data entered aligns with the specified search parameters.
4.	SQL Integration for Data Management:
o	SQL queries are used to retrieve and manage flight and hotel data from the database, ensuring efficient and accurate results.
o	Custom queries enable the platform to filter, sort, and display results dynamically, allowing users to find and book travel options with ease.
5.	PHP & MySQL Integration:
o	PHP is used to connect the backend application to the database, ensuring smooth retrieval and display of flight and hotel data.
o	MySQL is employed to store, manage, and serve the data, providing reliable and fast data access for users.
6.	Seamless User Interface:
o	The platform features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, built with React.js for dynamic rendering and efficient interactions.
o	A responsive design ensures the application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
7.	Booking Process for Flights and Hotels:
o	After selecting their desired flights and hotels, users can proceed to book by entering their personal information (e.g., name, SSN, date of birth).
o	Once confirmed, users can view all their booking details, including flight and hotel itineraries, along with passenger details.
Technologies Used:
Frontend:
•	React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used for creating dynamic, reusable components and managing application state.
•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core web technologies for building the structure, design, and interactivity of the web application.
Backend:
•	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building the backend of the application. Handles real-time interactions with users and manages the server-side logic.
•	Express.js: A lightweight framework for Node.js that facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
Database:
•	MySQL: A relational database management system used to store flight, hotel, and booking data. MySQL ensures that all the data is stored efficiently and can be retrieved with optimized SQL queries.
•	SQL Queries: Custom SQL queries are used to retrieve, filter, and display flight and hotel data dynamically.
Server-Side:
•	PHP: Used to connect the backend application with the MySQL database. PHP handles requests and queries to fetch real-time data for flights and hotels.
User Flow:
1.	Search Flights and Hotels:
o	Users input the departure and destination cities, travel dates, and the number of guests (adults, children, and infants).
o	The system validates the inputs to ensure they fall within the permissible criteria (e.g., valid travel dates, valid city selection).
2.	Display Real-Time Results:
o	Based on the user's search parameters, the application queries the database and displays a list of available flights and hotels.
o	Users can filter results by various parameters, including price, departure time, and hotel rating.
3.	Booking Process:
o	After selecting a flight and hotel, users proceed to book their tickets and accommodation.
o	The application collects passenger details (e.g., SSN, name, and date of birth) for flight bookings and guest details for hotel bookings.
4.	Confirmation:
o	Once the booking details are confirmed, the user receives a summary of their bookings, including flight and hotel information, along with total pricing and personal details.
Admin Features:
1.	Manage Hotel Data:
o	The admin can upload a JSON file containing information about available hotels, including hotel ID, name, city, and price per night. This data is then imported into the MySQL database.
2.	View and Retrieve Booking Information:
o	The admin can retrieve booking information for flights and hotels using flight booking IDs or hotel booking IDs.
o	The admin can view detailed reports, such as booked flights from specific cities, most expensive bookings, or flights with infant passengers.
3.	Filter by Criteria:
o	The admin has the ability to filter bookings by specific criteria, such as flights departing from Texas or bookings for a specific month (e.g., September 2024).
